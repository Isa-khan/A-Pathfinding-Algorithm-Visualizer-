Introduction
The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in computer science and game development. It finds the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid by intelligently exploring the most promising paths first. This project aims to provide a visual representation of the A* algorithm to help users gain a better understanding of how it works.

Features
Interactive grid-based map where users can place obstacles, start and end points.
Real-time visualization of the A* algorithm's execution.
Step-by-step mode to observe each iteration of the algorithm.
Adjustable speed control for the visualization.
Information about the path length, execution time, and number of nodes explored.
Reset functionality to clear the map and start over.
Installation
To run the A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
Ensure you have Python (version 3.x) installed on your system.
Install the required Python packages by running the following command in the project directory:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to start the application:
css
Copy code
python main.py
The application window will appear, displaying a grid-based map.
Left-click to place the start and end points on the map.
Left-click and drag to create walls or obstacles on the map.
Press the spacebar to start the A* algorithm visualization.
Use the step-by-step mode and speed control buttons to observe the algorithm's execution.
To reset the map, press the "Reset" button.
